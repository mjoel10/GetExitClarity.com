      question: "How long does the assessment take?",
      answer: "The assessment typically takes about 15â€“30 minutes. It's designed to be efficient while covering all 11 deal-critical readiness factors. Your advisor then reviews the results with you to provide context, recommendations, and next steps."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer: "ExitClarity is delivered through trusted advisors, wealth managers, and M&A professionals. Pricing may vary depending on your advisor relationship, but the goal is the same, to give you unbiased, actionable insights that strengthen your readiness and deal value."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you share my information?",
      answer: "No. Your information remains private and is only shared with the advisor you choose to work with. ExitClarity does not sell or distribute your data."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the valuation?",
      answer: "ExitClarity provides valuation ranges based on conservative EBITDA multiples and relevant market comps. These insights create a clear, fact-based baseline of what buyers are likely to pay. Your advisor then layers their deal expertise and knowledge of your industry and buyer pool to refine the picture."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not ready to sell?",
      answer: "That's exactly what ExitClarity is built for. Many owners aren't ready on the first try. Your advisor can use your results to highlight key gaps, set priorities, and create a plan to improve valuation and reduce risk before you go to market."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I retake the assessment?",
      answer: "Yes. Owners often retake the assessment to measure progress and update readiness. Your advisor can guide when and how to revisit it, so improvements are tracked and your timing stays on target."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I still need an advisor if I have ExitClarity?",
      answer: "Yes. ExitClarity doesn't replace your advisor, it enhances their ability to guide you. The platform delivers objective data and unbiased insights rooted in real owner sell-side experience, while your advisor applies deal expertise, strategy, and negotiation to turn those insights into a stronger exit outcome."

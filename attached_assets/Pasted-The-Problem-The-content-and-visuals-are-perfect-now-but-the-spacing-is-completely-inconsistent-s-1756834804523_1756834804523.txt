The Problem:
The content and visuals are perfect now, but the spacing is completely inconsistent - some sections are cramped, others have massive gaps, and mobile is a disaster. We need to rebuild the spacing system from scratch while keeping all current content and visuals.
Create a Consistent Spacing System:
1. Establish Clear Section Boundaries:

Between major sections: 80-100px on desktop, 60px on mobile
Hero to Stats section: This needs MORE space (currently cramped)
Stats to Ross section: Needs consistent padding
Between all other sections: Use the SAME spacing consistently

2. Fix Hero Section Spacing FIRST:

Move the entire left content block UP by 40-60px - it's sitting too low
Headline to subheadline: 20-24px gap (currently too tight)
Subheadline to bullet points: 40px gap minimum (currently cramped)
Bullet points to CTA button: 30px gap
CTA button to "Join 500+" text: 20px gap
Vertically center the left content with the right visual (currently bottom-heavy)
Add padding around the right visual - it needs breathing room

3. Fix Internal Section Spacing:
Statistics Section:

Cards need more internal padding (at least 30px)
Add more space between the cards themselves
"Know where you stand today" needs 40px margin above it
Ensure even distribution across the blue background

Ross's Section:

Photo needs 40px+ gap from text
Add subtle background to the quote with 20px padding
Space between paragraphs: 20px
Name/title under photo needs proper spacing

3-Step Process Section:

Icons need 20px from their titles
Report visual needs 30px padding around it
Bullet points need 1.8 line-height
Each step needs consistent spacing

Report Preview Section:

Center-align the visual properly
"This is what you'll receive" needs 30px from visual
Bullet points need 1.6 line-height and 10px between items
Add padding around the entire report card

Trust Signals Section:

Each item needs 40px vertical padding
Icons need 20px from text
Consistent spacing between the three columns

FAQ Section:

Each question needs 20px padding
Increase clickable area to full width
15px gap between question and answer

4. Mobile-Specific Fixes:

Stack EVERYTHING vertically on mobile
Hero visual goes BELOW text on mobile
Ross's photo centers above his bio
Report preview becomes full-width
Reduce all spacing by 30% on mobile but keep consistent
Ensure smooth transitions at breakpoints

5. Typography Line-Height Fixes:

Body text: 1.6-1.8 line-height everywhere
Headlines: Consistent 30-40px margin-bottom
Lists: 1.6 line-height with 8px between items

Implementation Approach:

Create CSS variables for consistency:

css:root {
  --section-gap: 100px;
  --section-gap-mobile: 60px;
  --content-padding: 40px;
  --content-padding-mobile: 20px;
  --heading-margin: 35px;
  --text-line-height: 1.7;
}

Apply systematically to every section
Test at all breakpoints:

Mobile: 320px, 375px, 414px
Tablet: 768px, 1024px
Desktop: 1280px, 1440px, 1920px


Ensure NO content changes - only spacing/layout

Critical Areas to Fix:

Hero content is too low and cramped
Inconsistent gaps between sections
Mobile layout is broken
Line-heights are too tight
Internal padding is inconsistent

Success Criteria:

Every section has room to breathe
Consistent spacing throughout
Perfect mobile experience
No cramped text anywhere
Professional, scannable layout
Content remains exactly as is

The goal: Transform the current cramped, inconsistent layout into a professional, well-spaced page that works perfectly on all devices while keeping all content and visuals unchanged.

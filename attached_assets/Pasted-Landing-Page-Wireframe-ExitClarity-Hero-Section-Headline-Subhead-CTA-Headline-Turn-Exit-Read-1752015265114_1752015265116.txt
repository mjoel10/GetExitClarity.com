Section 1: The Problem We're Solving (For Firms & Owners)
Headline:
Most Exit Conversations Stall Because Readiness Is Unclear
Copy:
M&A professionals waste time on prospects who aren’t ready. Business owners wait too long, unprepared and overconfident. ExitClarity bridges that gap with structured, scalable intelligence that moves both sides forward.

Section 1.75: Why So Many Deals Fall Apart Before They Begin

Revenue ≠ Exit Ready
Top-line growth doesn’t matter if financials aren’t clean, predictable, and documented.

Operational Blind Spots
Key-person risk, poor systems, and undocumented processes stall deals in diligence.

Unrealistic Expectations
Inflated valuations and short timelines kill trust before deals can even start.

Inadequate Representation
The wrong advisor (or no advisor) leads to costly mistakes in high-stakes negotiations.

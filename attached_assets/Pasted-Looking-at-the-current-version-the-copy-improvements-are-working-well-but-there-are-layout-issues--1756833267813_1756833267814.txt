Looking at the current version, the copy improvements are working well, but there are layout issues to fix:
1. Fix "Most Business Owners Aren't Ready" Section Layout

The 3 statistics need proper spacing and alignment
Ensure they're in a clean 3-column grid on desktop
Stack them vertically on mobile
The blue background looks good but needs padding adjustments

2. Fix Ross's Story Section Layout
Current issue: The layout feels cramped and the two quotes are confusing
Changes needed:

Replace the "RJ" initials circle with Ross's actual photo (the one provided showing him at the beach)
Remove the second testimonial quote - keep only Ross's main founder quote
Better layout structure:

Left side (60%): Ross's story text + his single quote
Right side (40%): Ross's photo with name/title/experience below


Add more breathing room between elements
Ensure the quote stands out with proper styling

3. Additional Quick Fixes

Make sure the "Your Personalized Exit Readiness Report" section that follows has proper spacing from Ross's section
Verify all CTAs are consistently styled with the blue color
Check that the page flows smoothly between sections

The content is much improved with the new statistics and cleaner copy - now we just need to fix these layout regressions to make it visually polished.RetryMI also feel like the text size is too big on the 3 column grid, and it has a weird almost subheadline below itEditYou're right on both counts. Here's what to tell the Replit agent:
Fix the Statistics Section Typography and Layout
The Problem:

The text under each statistic is too large and overwhelming
There's an unnecessary subheadline below the main headline that creates awkward spacing

Specific Fixes:
1. Remove the subheadline

Delete "of business owners have no exit strategy" / "average value left on the table" / "months typical prep time needed"
These are redundant and making the section feel cluttered

2. Adjust the layout to:
80%
of business owners have no exit strategy

$10M+
average value left on the table  

18-24
months typical prep time needed
3. Typography adjustments:

Keep the large numbers (80%, $10M+, 18-24) as they are - they need impact
Make the descriptive text underneath MUCH smaller - maybe 14-16px instead of current size
This creates better visual hierarchy where the numbers pop and the explanations support

4. Spacing:

Add more padding between the three columns
Reduce the line height between the number and its description
The section needs to breathe but not feel disconnected

The goal is for viewers to immediately see "80% - $10M+ - 18-24" at a glance, with the supporting text there if they want details but not competing for attention.

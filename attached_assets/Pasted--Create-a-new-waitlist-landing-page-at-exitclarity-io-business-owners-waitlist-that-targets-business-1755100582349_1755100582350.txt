"Create a new waitlist landing page at exitclarity.io/business-owners-waitlist that targets business owners directly (separate from our M&A firm enterprise product).

REQUIREMENTS:
1. New route: /business-owners-waitlist
2. Leverage existing content from main site but rewrite for business owners
3. Simple waitlist form 
4. Should NOT be accessible from the main site navigation, this will be for ad traffic
5. Professional design matching current ExitClarity branding
6. Clear value proposition for business owners considering exit
7. Include interactive visuals to demonstrate the platform experience

VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
- Hero section with assessment progress visual (using assessment-platform code)
- Sample report preview (using comprehensive-report code)
- Both visuals should be embedded as interactive demonstrations

FORM FIELDS NEEDED:
- First Name
- Last Name  
- Business Email
- Company Name
- Industry (dropdown)
- Annual Revenue Range (dropdown: Under $1M, $1M-$3M, $3M-$7M, $7M-$15M, $15M-$30M, $30M+)
- Adjusted EBITDA Range (dropdown: Under $250K, $250K-$750K, $750K-$1.5M, $1.5M-$3M, $3M-$7M, $7M+, Not Sure)
- Expected Exit Timeline (dropdown: 0-1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years, 5+ years)
- Biggest Exit Concern (text area)

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
- Hero: 'Be First to Access Professional Exit Analysis'
- Interactive assessment preview (scaled down from assessment-platform.html)
- Value props from main site but business-owner focused
- Sample report preview (scaled down from comprehensive-report.html)
- Social proof: 'Join 500+ Business Owners on Early Access'
- Process overview (simplified)
- Waitlist form with CTA: 'Join Early Access Waitlist'
- Footer: 'Professional M&A analysis coming soon for business owners'

DESIGN:
- Same ExitClarity branding and color scheme
- Professional but approachable tone
- Mobile-responsive
- Form saves to database with 'waitlist' status
- Embed the visual demos as smaller, contained sections

Please rewrite the main site copy to speak directly to business owners instead of M&A firms, focusing on lower middle market businesses ($1M-$30M revenue range), and integrate the assessment and report visuals as compelling demonstrations of what they'll receive."

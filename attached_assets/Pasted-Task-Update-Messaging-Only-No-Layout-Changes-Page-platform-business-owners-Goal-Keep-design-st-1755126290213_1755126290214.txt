5) Form Block (Keep fields; change surrounding copy)

6) Final CTA band (dark block)
Headline → Ready to See Your Business Through M&A Eyes?

Subhead →

7) Global CTA Unification (this page only)
Replace any other button labels on this page (e.g., “Download Sample Report”, “Get Early Access to This Analysis”, “Secure My Early Access Spot”) with:
Join Early Access Waitlist

If the “Download Sample Report” link must remain for SEO/internal reasons, keep the hidden link or move it to a text link in body copy (not a button) with: Prefer a preview? View a sample report.

8) SEO metadata (messaging-only, no structural change)
Meta title → ExitClarity for Business Owners – Discover Your True Exit Value (Early Access)

Meta description →
Get an unbiased, M&A-grade exit readiness assessment. Understand your valuation, uncover risks, and get a plan to sell for more—before hiring advisors. Join the early access waitlist.

9) Acceptance criteria
Visual layout and spacing are unchanged.

Every button on this page reads “Join Early Access Waitlist.”

All new copy above is visible in the same sections as before.

Form still posts to the same endpoint.

Existing tracking stays intact; update button text events if they depend on label.

10) (Optional) Centralize strings
If you’re using React/Next, add/update a copy/businessOwners.ts (or similar) and reference these strings from components so future edits are one-file changes.

If you paste these into your Replit task exactly, they’ll know what to change and where—no layout work required.








You said:
I also feel like the the text sizing and spacing is still super inconsistent


ChatGPT said:
Yeah — even if you keep the structure, the inconsistent text sizing and spacing is going to make the page feel less polished and harder to read, which can hurt conversions.

Here’s exactly what you can tell your Replit agent so they fix that without redesigning the page:

Instruction: Standardize Typography & Spacing (Messaging Update Compatible)
1. Headings

Use a single, consistent font size hierarchy across the page:

H1 (main hero headline): 36–42px desktop, 28–32px mobile.

H2 (section titles): 28–32px desktop, 22–26px mobile.

H3 (feature card titles, bullets): 20–22px desktop, 18–20px mobile.

Keep all headings same weight (e.g., semi-bold) for visual consistency.

Ensure line height ~1.2–1.3 for all headings.

2. Body Text

Use a consistent size for all paragraphs across the page:

Desktop: 16–18px, Mobile: 15–16px.

Line height ~1.5–1.6 for readability.

No section should mix different font sizes for body copy unless it’s intentional emphasis.

3. Buttons (All CTAs: “Join Early Access Waitlist”)

Same font size (16–18px) and weight.

Same padding (e.g., 12–16px top/bottom, 24–32px left/right).

Consistent border radius, background color, and hover effect.

4. Spacing Between Sections

Apply a consistent vertical rhythm:

48–64px between major sections.

24–32px between headings and body text.

16–20px between body text and button.

Avoid large jumps in spacing that aren’t tied to section breaks.

5. Mobile Optimization

Ensure all headings scale down proportionally.

Avoid cramped spacing — minimum 16px padding on mobile edges.

Stack columns vertically with consistent 24–32px gap between them.

6. Feature Cards & Bulleted Lists

Keep icon size consistent across cards.

Equal spacing between icon, title, and description.

Use the same bullet style and indentation for all lists.

7. Alignment

All text blocks in a section should align to the same baseline grid.

Avoid “wandering” section titles that don’t line up with body copy.

Extra tip for your dev:
If they add a simple typography scale & spacing system to the CSS (e.g., --heading-lg, --heading-md, --body-lg), then all your text and spacing changes can be controlled from one place instead of being inconsistent per section.

# Replit Agent: Landing Page Cleanup Instructions

## OBJECTIVE: Transform the current cluttered landing page into a high-converting, streamlined experience

The current landing page is too long and visually overwhelming. Follow these organized instructions to create a focused, professional page that drives conversions.

---

## PART 1: CONTENT CHANGES

### Sections to DELETE Completely
Remove these sections entirely from the page:
- **"Everything You Need to Make Informed Decisions" 8-grid section** - Redundant with report preview
- **Business owner testimonials section** - Ross's story provides sufficient credibility
- **Bottom stats section with completion percentages** - Unnecessary
- **All decorative visual elements** - Particles, animations that don't serve a purpose

### Sections to KEEP and IMPROVE

#### "Most Business Owners Aren't Ready" Statistics Section
**Current Problems:** Weak stats, poor visual separation, small text

**Improvements:**
- Change background to mid-blue (#1e40af) with white text for contrast
- Replace with these 3 powerful statistics:
  - **"80%** of business owners have no exit strategy"
  - **"$10M+** average value left on the table"  
  - **"18-24** months typical prep time needed"
- Make numbers 64px bold, descriptions 18px
- Add closing line: "Know where you stand today."

#### Ross's Story Section
**Keep this section but refine:**
- Maintain all content (crucial for credibility)
- Improve layout with better spacing
- Simplify testimonial card design
- Make photo/initials smaller and cleaner

#### 3-Step Process Section
**Simplify dramatically:**
- Horizontal layout (not stacked)
- Icons + titles + one line description only
- Keep device frames if they help show the report professionally
- Show the key report elements clearly: score gauge, GO badge, valuation range

## PART 2: VISUAL & DESIGN CLEANUP

### Hero Section
- Remove heavy teal laptop frame on right side
- Choose ONE visual: either progress interface OR simplified report
- Tighten left side content spacing
- Reduce line height

### Color Consistency
- **Primary blue:** #0B5FFF for all CTAs
- **Mid-blue:** #1e40af for stats section background
- **Backgrounds:** White or light gray (#F8F9FA) only
- Remove ALL gradients except hero
- Pick either blue OR teal theme (not both)

### Visual Standardization
- Keep device frames if they add context and professionalism
- Standardize card styles (consistent radius, padding, shadows)
- Delete only decorative elements that serve no purpose
- Keep current font sizes and typography (they're working well)

## PART 3: LAYOUT & SPACING

### Vertical Spacing Reductions
- Cut section padding by 40%
- Reduce card internal padding by 30%
- Tighten line-height to 1.5
- Remove excessive white space between elements

### Mobile Optimization
- Single column for all content
- Full-width CTAs
- Hide complex visuals, show simplified versions
- Appropriate font size reductions

1. **Header** - Sticky, minimal (logo + CTA)
2. **Hero** - One viewport height max
3. **Problem Stats** - Mid-blue background, 3 large stats
4. **Ross's Story** - Founder credibility
5. **3-Step Process + Report Preview** - Horizontal, simplified
6. **Trust Signals** - 3 icons: Owner-First, 30+ Years, Private & Secure
7. **FAQ** - 4-6 questions, collapsed by default

## CONVERSION PRINCIPLES

Every element must answer one of these questions:
1. **What is this?** Exit readiness assessment
2. **What do I get?** Personalized report with valuation
3. **How long?** 20 minutes
4. **Can I trust this?** Ross's story + credentials
5. **How do I start?** Clear CTAs

**If an element doesn't support these, DELETE IT.**

Remember: The goal is to get visitors to click "Start Free Assessment." Everything else is secondary. When in doubt, remove it.

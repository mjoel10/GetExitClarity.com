The Ultimate Exit: Why 87% of Business Sales Fail (And How to Be in the 13% That Don't)
5 min read | Exit Planning
You've built something remarkable. Years of early mornings, late nights, and countless decisions have created a business that matters—to customers, employees, and the market. But here's what no one tells you about selling that business: The difference between a successful exit and a failed one isn't luck. It's preparation.
And most owners aren't prepared at all.
The Brutal Truth About Business Exits
Recent data shows that exit preparation typically begins 12-18 months before engaging advisors 8. Exit Readiness Assessment - Waypoint Partners, yet most business owners start thinking about their exit just 6 months before they want to close. That gap—between when preparation should start and when it actually does—costs millions in lost value.
Consider these realities:

73% of business owners regret their exit within 12 months of closing
Only 20% of businesses that go to market actually sell
The average business takes 9-12 months to sell after hitting the market
Deal fatigue kills more transactions than valuation disputes

The problem isn't that these businesses lack value. It's that their owners confused having a valuable business with having a sellable business. There's a massive difference.
The GO/FIX/WAIT Framework: Your North Star for Exit Timing
Not every business that wants to sell should sell now. And not every fixable issue is worth fixing before going to market. The key is knowing the difference.
GO: When You're Genuinely Ready
Your business is ready for market when:

Financial performance is consistent with 3+ years of clean, auditable financials
Owner dependency is minimal—the business runs without you for 30+ days
Customer concentration is balanced—no single customer exceeds 20% of revenue
Management team is proven and incentivized to stay post-sale
Growth trajectory is clear with documented systems and processes

If you check these boxes, you're in the elite 13% ready to achieve a successful exit.
FIX: Issues Worth Delaying For
Some problems significantly impact valuation or kill deals entirely:
Financial Infrastructure (3-6 months to fix)
Messy books are the fastest way to lose a buyer. If your monthly financials aren't GAAP-compliant or you can't produce a trailing twelve months P&L on demand, fix this first. Quality financial statements and improved internal controls are essential for successful exits 8. Exit Readiness Assessment - Waypoint Partners.
Customer Concentration Risk (6-12 months to fix)
When one customer represents 30%+ of revenue, you're not selling a business—you're selling a hostage situation. Diversification takes time but can double your multiple.
Leadership Gaps (12-18 months to fix)
Owner dependence is a critical risk factor that must be addressed before sale Mastering M&A Sell-Side Readiness in Today’s Landscape. Building a management team that can operate without you isn't just about delegation—it's about creating institutional knowledge that survives your departure.
WAIT: When Patience Pays
Sometimes the best move is no move:

Market timing is unfavorable (industry downturn, regulatory uncertainty)
Major contracts are renewing within 6 months
Strategic initiatives are mid-flight with value not yet realized
Personal readiness isn't there—and that's okay

The Hidden Costs of Poor Preparation
Every unprepared exit attempt carries compounding costs:
Direct Costs:

40-80 hours of management time per failed process
$50,000-150,000 in advisory fees and due diligence
6-12 months of distracted leadership

Opportunity Costs:

Missing better buyers while chasing bad ones
Burning out your best people with fire drills
Competitors gaining ground while you're distracted

Reputation Costs:

Once you're "shopped," future buyers question why you didn't sell
Failed processes leak to employees, customers, and competitors
Your advisors lose credibility taking unprepared companies to market

The Data-Driven Path to Exit Success
Modern exit planning isn't about gut feelings—it's about systematic assessment across proven dimensions. An exit-readiness assessment involves a comprehensive review of current business functions, historical performance, and future projections 8. Exit Readiness Assessment - Waypoint Partners.
The most successful exits follow this progression:
Phase 1: Assessment (Month 1)

Objective evaluation across 11 critical factors
Benchmark against actual market comparables
Identify GO/FIX/WAIT status with clear rationale

Phase 2: Preparation (Months 2-12)

Address identified gaps systematically
Build institutional strength beyond the owner
Create the value story buyers actually care about

Phase 3: Positioning (Months 13-15)

Develop strategic buyer targeting
Prepare management for the process
Build the data room proactively, not reactively

Phase 4: Process (Months 16-24)

Run competitive process with qualified buyers
Maintain business momentum during diligence
Close at maximum value with minimum friction

Why Most Owners Get This Wrong (And How You Won't)
The traditional approach to exit planning is fundamentally broken:

Advisors engage too late when problems are baked in
Valuations happen in isolation without fixing underlying issues
Owners operate on emotion rather than data
Preparation is reactive rather than strategic

The modern approach—the one that actually works—is different:

Start with data, not opinions
Fix strategically, not comprehensively
Build transferable value, not just profitable operations
Track progress systematically, not sporadically

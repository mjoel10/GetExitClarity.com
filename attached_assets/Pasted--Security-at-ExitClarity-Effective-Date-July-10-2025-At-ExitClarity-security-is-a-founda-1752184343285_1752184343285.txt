**Security at ExitClarity**

**Effective Date:** July 10, 2025

At ExitClarity, security is a foundational part of how we build, operate, and deliver our platform. We understand the sensitivity of the financial and strategic data our users share, and we take that responsibility seriously.

## 1. Data Protection Principles

We follow industry best practices and security frameworks for handling sensitive business and personal data:

* **Confidentiality**: Access to your data is restricted to authorized users and team members through access controls and authentication mechanisms.
* **Integrity**: All data is encrypted and monitored to prevent unauthorized tampering or modification.
* **Availability**: Our platform is designed for high reliability and uptime to ensure uninterrupted service.
* **Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy considerations are integrated into the platform architecture from the ground up.

## 2. Secure Data Protection

Your information is protected by multiple layers of security:

* **Encryption at Rest**: All stored data is protected with AES-256 encryption.
* **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmission is protected using TLS 1.3 encryption.
* **Database Security**: Encrypted databases include additional access controls and audit logging.
* **Backup Protection**: Backups are encrypted and stored securely in geographically redundant locations.

## 3. Infrastructure Security

* **Hosting Environment**: ExitClarity is hosted on SOC 2 Type II compliant infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS, GCP) with built-in redundancy, DDoS protection, and fault tolerance.
* **Monitoring**: We utilize cloud-native monitoring tools and alerts to detect unusual activity.
* **Network Security**: Includes traffic filtering, firewall configurations, and internal network segmentation.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Periodic internal reviews and vulnerability scans are conducted to identify and remediate potential risks.

## 4. Application Security

* **Authentication**: User authentication is protected using securely hashed credentials.
* **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users only access the data necessary for their role.
* **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeouts and token-based authentication.
* **Audit Logging**: System activity is logged and reviewed to detect unauthorized access or anomalies.

## 5. Vendor & Data Privacy Controls

* We work with carefully selected third-party service providers who meet high security and compliance standards.
* Third-party access is limited to the minimum necessary to perform contracted functions.

# Replit Agent Prompt: ExitClarity Landing Page Remix

## Project Overview
**IMPORTANT: This is a REMIX of the existing exitclarity.io website.** Take the existing exitclarity.io Replit project and repurpose it into a single, high-converting landing page at getexitclarity.com. Delete all other pages and routes. Reuse the existing brand assets, components, styles, and code where applicable. The focus is exclusively on getting business owners to take the exit readiness assessment.

## Starting Point
- Begin with the existing exitclarity.io codebase
- **DELETE all pages/routes except the landing page**
- Preserve brand assets, logos, colors, fonts, and component styles
- **Keep ONLY the footer structure from the original site**
- Reuse existing React components and Tailwind classes where useful
- Create a fresh, conversion-focused header specifically for this landing page

## Core Requirements

### 1. Technical Stack
- Use React with TailwindCSS
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness
- Implement smooth scroll animations
- Add hover effects and micro-interactions
- Optimize for fast loading (lazy load images)
- **IMPORTANT: This is a remix of the existing exitclarity.io website - reuse all existing brand assets, colors, and components**

### 2. Design System (Reuse from existing exitclarity.io)
- **USE THE EXISTING EXITCLARITY.IO BRAND ASSETS:**
  - Copy all logos, icons, and brand elements directly from the current site
  - Maintain exact color palette from exitclarity.io
  - Use the same fonts and typography system
  - Keep consistent spacing and component styles
- **Extracted from visuals:**
  - Primary gradient: #6e7fff to #4a5f8f (for accents)
  - Success green: #00B67A (for CTAs and checkmarks)
  - Dark backgrounds: #18181b, #1A2C56
  - Light backgrounds: #f9fafb, #f3f4f6
- **Maintain consistency:** This is a remix, not a redesign - keep brand continuity

### 3. Assets to Reuse
- **Assessment Platform Visual (assessment-platform.html)**: Use the animated progress interface showing "8 of 11 factors" with the progress bar and factor grid
- **Comprehensive Report Visual (comprehensive-report.html)**: Use the Executive Summary view with the 70/100 score gauge and "GO - Proceed to Market" recommendation
- **Progress Card Visual (Image 1)**: Use the clean progress indicator showing "85% Assessment Progress" with categories completed
- **Platform Interface Visual (Image 2)**: Use the ExitClarity platform interface showing the step-by-step assessment flow
- Extract color schemes: Purple/blue gradients (#6e7fff to #4a5f8f), green accents (#00B67A), navy (#1A2C56)
- DO NOT use any M&A dashboard visuals

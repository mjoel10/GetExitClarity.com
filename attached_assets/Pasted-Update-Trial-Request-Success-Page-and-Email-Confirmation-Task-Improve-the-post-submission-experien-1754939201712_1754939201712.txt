Update Trial Request Success Page and Email Confirmation

Task: Improve the post-submission experience for trial requests with better messaging and engagement options.

PART 1: Update Success Page (/trial-request success state)

Replace current success message with:

Title: "Welcome to ExitClarity!" 
Subhead: "We'll confirm access for your firm within 1-3 business days."

Add three action boxes (cards) below:

Box 1:
- Icon: chart icon
- Title: "View Sample Report"
- Description: "See exactly what your clients will receive"
- Button: "View Sample Report" â†’ /sample-report

Box 2:
- Icon: calendar icon
- Title: "Schedule a Quick Demo"
- Description: "Want to see ExitClarity in action sooner?"
- Link: "Book 15-min Overview" â†’ [your calendar link]

Box 3:
- Icon: book icon
- Title: "Explore Resources"
- Description: "Browse our exit planning insights"
- Link: "Visit Resource Center" â†’ /resources

Footer text (smaller, gray):
"Questions? Reply to your confirmation email or reach out at support@exitclarity.io"

Styling:
- Keep the green checkmark at top
- Cards should be in horizontal row on desktop, stack on mobile
- Use subtle shadows on cards
- Maintain brand colors

PART 2: Update Email Confirmation Template

Update SendGrid email template:

Subject Line:
"Welcome to ExitClarity - Next Steps Inside"

Email Body:

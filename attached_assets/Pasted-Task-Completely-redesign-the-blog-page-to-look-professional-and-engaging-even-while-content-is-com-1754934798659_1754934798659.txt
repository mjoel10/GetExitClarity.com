Task: Completely redesign the blog page to look professional and engaging, even while content is coming soon.

Remove current design and replace with:

1. Hero Section:
- Keep title: "ExitClarity Blog"
- Keep subtitle: "Insights and strategies for M&A professionals"
- Add a subtle background gradient or pattern to add visual interest

2. Replace the bland "Coming Soon" box with a Featured Article Preview:
Create a mock featured article card that shows what content will look like:
- Large hero image placeholder (use a professional gradient or abstract business image)
- Article title: "The Complete Guide to Exit Readiness Assessment"
- Meta info: "By ExitClarity Team • Coming January 2025 • 8 min read"
- Preview text: "Discover how top M&A advisors are using data-driven assessments to identify exit-ready prospects and accelerate deal timelines..."
- "Read More →" link (disabled/grayed out)
- Add a subtle "Coming Soon" badge in the corner

3. Recent Articles Grid (3 cards):
Create 3 professional article preview cards with:
- Thumbnail placeholder
- Title (examples):
  * "5 Signs Your Client Isn't Exit-Ready"
  * "Maximizing Valuations in 2025"
  * "The Hidden Costs of Poor Deal Preparation"
- Date: "Coming Soon"
- Category badge (Exit Planning, Valuations, M&A Trends)
- Short excerpt
- Make cards look finished but with "Coming Soon" indicators

4. Newsletter Signup Section:
- Headline: "Get First Access to New Content"
- Subtext: "Be notified when we publish new insights for M&A professionals"
- Email input field
- "Notify Me" button
- This makes the page useful even before content is live

5. Remove the "Upcoming Content Categories" section entirely - it looks unprofessional

Design requirements:
- Use card-based design with subtle shadows
- Add hover effects on cards
- Use brand colors consistently
- Ensure mobile responsive
- Make it look like a real blog that's about to launch, not an empty placeholder

The goal: Visitors should see what kind of high-quality content is coming and want to subscribe, not see an empty page.
